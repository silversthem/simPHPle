# What is simPHPle ?
A great and easy to use php framework. Probably the best, most likely not.
### How to use ?
We'll see once its done.
### Why use it ?
Because it's cool, and you want to be cool, don't you ? Make your parents proud.
### How did you become so great ?
I can't tell all my secrets on here.
### What's your credit card number ?
I'm starting to feel like this isn't what I thought it was.
### Seriously though, what kind of license do you put on that thing ?
Use it for whatever you like, I don't care, it's not that great anyway (I know you're strongly disagreeing, but keep your pants up).
### You are awfully pretentious, aren't you ?
Yeah.
### What's up with the versions ?
Okay, so here goes :
- Versions below 1 are only there for historic purposes, you could say they're relics from an ancient time (and you probably will)
- Integer numbered versions are stable and functionnal, that are the ones you should use
- Versions > 1 with 1 decimal add new features/patch security flaws/corrects bugs, but are still good for building stuff
- Versions > 1 with 2 decimals contain experimental features, I'm basically testing stuff that I like (and you'll love it, most of the time)
- The 0.0.0 folder (not yet existant, in case you didn't notice) contains modules and libraries that you can use. They're probably the best code you'll see in your entire life, so check them out.
